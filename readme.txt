Project description:
Make an International Space Station (ISS) tracking application.  Pick only ONE of the following platforms:

Windows: use C# and WPF
Android: use Java
iOS: use interface builder to make UI, and nibs / storyboards
Web: use express backend and webpack / html front end (yes, we want a single page website hosted with express, not just a standalone html webpage with javascript frontend)

For any platform chosen:
Any bootstrapper or code from previous personal projects can be used, so long as the tools detailed above are also used.  Package managers are acceptable, and encouraged.  We want to see how you are able to work with libraries as well as write your own code.

Goal:
Create an ISS tracking app that can tell the user when the ISS is going to pass over a target location
